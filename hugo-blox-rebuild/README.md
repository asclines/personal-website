# Hugo Blox Rebuild: Migration Context Dump

This folder contains all the context, content, and configuration needed to rebuild your personal website from scratch using the latest Hugo Blox (Wowchemy) starter. Use these files as reference or as direct input for a clean, modern, and maintainable site.

## Structure
- `content/` — All homepage sections, author profile, and sample content.
- `static/` — Images, resume PDF, and other static assets.
- `config/` — Site configuration (params, menus, etc.) in YAML for clarity.
- `migration-notes.md` — Key migration decisions, gotchas, and parity notes.

## Usage
- Reference or copy these files into a new Hugo Blox starter site.
- Adjust as needed for new theme conventions or to remove legacy cruft.
- See `migration-notes.md` for tips on achieving parity and modernizing.
