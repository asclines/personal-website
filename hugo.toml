Apple gave me the opportunity to grow into senior engineering and, later, management—roles where I’ve combined technical leadership with a passion for building products that matter.\n\nI believe managers should stay technical: writing code, providing meaningful technical feedback, and setting the tone for ownership and autonomy. I coach my team to think in terms of user impact, to thrive in ambiguity, and to take pride in building things that directly improve people’s lives.\n\nOutside of work, you’ll usually find me exploring new food and wine, camping or hiking in the Santa Cruz Mountains, or spending time with my wife Katie and our corgi, Princess Leia."
