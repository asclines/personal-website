  SWE on a NLP team under Google AI Language focused on all things related to
applying new NLP technologies towards solutions for Google. My work can be
summarized into 2 sections.
  
  **Research**
 
Technologies and methodologies used for confidential internal research are:
  * Implementation of unsupervised methods including clustering for
managing large quantities of text.
  * Utilization of LSTM networks.
  * Distillation of BERT models.
  
  
  <br>

  **Infrastructure**
  

Developed and improved many pipelines/frameworks within Google in relation to
NLP data. A majority of this work involved scalable, distributed computing
in C++ with a wide variety of Google’s internal tools. <br>
This included contributing to datasets like A Challenge Set and Methods for
Noun-Verb Ambiguity and others expected to be open sourced by end of 2020. 1
Contributed to the deployment of several models (including Sentiment Analysis)
that are launched in production today.
